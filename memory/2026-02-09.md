## Compliance Corpus Work (Late Night Session)

### Context
Abdul wants bot results — not just plans but actual authored compliance docs that go into the Knowledge Vault and make Shield Bot smarter immediately.

### What Was Done

**1. Compliance Corpus Proposal** (`docs/compliance-corpus-proposal.md`)
- Full inventory of existing repo content (4 thin mock docs, FAQs, product knowledge)
- Identified gaps: ~80% of typical vendor questionnaire questions unanswerable
- Proposed 16-doc minimum viable corpus with sensitivity levels, chunking strategies
- 2-week ingestion schedule with impact projections
- Templates for 5 key documents (subprocessor list, incident response, retention, encryption, DPA)

**2. First 3 Authored Docs (Batch 1)**
- `data/compliance-vault/public/subprocessors.md` — ✅ DONE. Truthful subprocessor list built from codebase analysis (OpenAI, Vercel, Neon, Telegram). Includes data flow diagram.
- `data/compliance-vault/public/security-overview.md` — ✅ DONE. Full public security page content. Honest about SOC2 (designed not audited), encryption at rest (provider-managed), no false claims. Replaces the `/security` placeholder.
- `data/compliance-vault/nda/data-retention-deletion-policy.md` — ✅ DONE. Specific retention periods per data category. Session TTL (7 days), lead data (24 months), logs (Vercel-managed). Deletion procedures, GDPR Article 17 process.

**3. Pipeline Wiring**
- Updated `scripts/ingest-vault.ts` to include `data/compliance-vault/public/` and `data/compliance-vault/nda/`
- Updated `src/lib/embeddings.ts` to read from ALL vault directories (was only reading first valid dir)
- Added `humanizeSourceTitle` mappings for all 16 planned docs so citations render nicely

**4. Ingestion Order Tracker** (`docs/compliance-corpus-ingestion-order.md`)
- 5-batch schedule with status tracking
- Coverage projections per batch (20% → 35% → 50% → 60% → 70% → 85%)

### What's Next (Batch 2)
- Encryption & Key Management Policy
- Incident Response Summary
- Access Control Policy

### Key Decisions
- Directory structure: `data/compliance-vault/{public,nda,internal}` — sensitivity encoded in path
- All docs grounded in codebase reality, not aspirational claims
- Existing mocks in `data/sample-vault/` left in place for now (still useful for demo)
- The 3 authored docs use `[PLACEHOLDER]` markers ONLY where VaultFill team input is truly needed (e.g., specific notification commitment timelines in IR)
