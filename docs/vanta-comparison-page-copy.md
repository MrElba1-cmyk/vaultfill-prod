### VaultFill vs. Vanta — An Honest Comparison

**Vanta is a great compliance platform. VaultFill is a different tool for a different job.**

Vanta helps companies manage entire compliance programs — SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and more — across hundreds of integrations. VaultFill does one thing exceptionally well: **answer security questionnaires fast, accurately, and privately.**

If you need a full compliance platform, Vanta may be the right choice. If you need to stop losing days to repetitive questionnaire work, keep reading.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Area | VaultFill | Vanta |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Approach** | Document-native AI — upload your docs, get answers | Integration-heavy — connects to your full tech stack |
| **Setup Time** | Minutes. Upload documents, start answering. | Weeks. Requires onboarding, integration setup, and configuration. |
| **Privacy** | Zero-knowledge architecture. Your docs stay yours. | Requires deep access to cloud infrastructure, repos, and HR systems. |
| **Focus** | Purpose-built for security questionnaire automation | Broad compliance platform (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.) |
| **Citations** | RAG-powered — every answer links back to your source documents | AI-assisted answers without granular source attribution |
| **Data Residency** | Texas-based infrastructure with local data control | Cloud-dependent with standard enterprise hosting |
| **Pricing** | Lean startup pricing — built for founders and small teams | Enterprise-tier pricing ($10K–$20K+/year with add-ons) |

## Why Teams Are Switching

### 1. Integration Fatigue

Vanta's power comes from 300+ integrations — connecting your AWS, GitHub, HR tools, identity providers, and more. For many teams, especially lean startups, that's a feature that becomes a burden. Every integration needs setup, maintenance, and monitoring. When one breaks, your compliance posture looks broken too.

**VaultFill takes a different path.** Upload your existing security docs — policies, SOC 2 reports, penetration test results — and the AI learns from what you already have. No API keys. No broken webhooks. No integration debt.

### 2. Privacy Concerns

To do its job, Vanta needs read access across your infrastructure: cloud accounts, code repositories, endpoint management, HR platforms. For companies handling sensitive data or operating under strict privacy requirements, that level of access can be a dealbreaker.

**VaultFill operates on a zero-knowledge model.** We process your uploaded documents — nothing more. We don't connect to your infrastructure, read your codebase, or access employee data. Your security posture stays between you and your documents.

### 3. Questionnaire-Specific Focus

Vanta is a compliance *platform* — it monitors controls, collects evidence, manages audits, and yes, helps with questionnaires. But questionnaire automation is one feature among dozens. When that's the problem you actually need solved *today*, a purpose-built tool outperforms a Swiss Army knife.

**VaultFill is built from the ground up for one workflow:** turning your existing documentation into accurate, cited, human-quality questionnaire responses. Our RAG-powered Shield Bot doesn't just generate generic answers — it pulls from *your* specific evidence and links every response back to the source.

## Who VaultFill Is For

VaultFill is built for teams who:

- **Spend hours every week** copy-pasting answers into security questionnaires and vendor assessments
- **Don't need (or want) a full compliance platform** — they already have their policies, SOC 2 report, and controls in place
- **Care deeply about data privacy** and don't want to hand infrastructure access to another vendor
- **Need to move fast** — a founder closing a deal shouldn't wait weeks for onboarding
- **Operate with lean teams** where the person answering questionnaires is also the person building the product

If that sounds like you, VaultFill fits. If you need continuous compliance monitoring across multiple frameworks with deep infrastructure integrations, Vanta is worth evaluating.
