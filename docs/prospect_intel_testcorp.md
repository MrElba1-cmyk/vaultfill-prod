## 1. Company Profile

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Domain** | testcorp.com |
| **Entity** | TestCorp Brand Network |
| **Industry** | Test & Measurement Equipment (Domain Portfolio / Lead Generation) |
| **Business Model** | Owns a network of premium test-equipment domain names (TestEquipment.com, Oscilloscope.com, SpectrumAnalyzer.com, etc.) and monetizes them via advertising, brand promotion, and lead generation for the T&M industry. |
| **Company Type** | Private, small team |
| **Related Entity** | A separate "Testcorp" (testcorp.net) operates in **aviation fire-safety testing** — FAA-accepted lab, Airbus-approved, with FAA DERs and Boeing Unit Members on staff. Founded 2000. |

### Key Observation
testcorp.com is primarily a **domain portfolio / lead-gen holding company** for test equipment brands — not a large operating enterprise. The aviation-testing entity at testcorp.net is a distinct business. The prospect value depends on which entity is the actual target.

---

## 2. Security & Compliance Landscape

### testcorp.com (Brand Network)
- **No public security certifications found** (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)
- No recent security/compliance news or breach disclosures.
- As a small domain-portfolio company, they likely have minimal formal compliance posture.

### testcorp.net (Aviation Testing Lab)
- Operates under **FAA regulatory oversight** — must maintain FAA acceptance and Airbus approval.
- Aviation compliance is heavily regulated but via **industry-specific frameworks** (FAA Fire Test Handbook, DO-160, etc.), not typical IT compliance (SOC 2/ISO 27001).
- No recent security incidents found in public sources.

## 3. Pain Points — "Manual/Spreadsheet" Process Mapping

If TestCorp (either entity) is managing compliance via manual/spreadsheet processes, the likely pain points are:

| Pain Point | Impact | Opportunity |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Evidence collection via spreadsheets** | Hours of manual screenshot/doc gathering before audits or FAA reviews | Automated evidence collection |
| **No continuous monitoring** | Compliance drift between audit cycles; surprises at review time | Continuous control monitoring |
| **Version control chaos** | Multiple spreadsheet versions, unclear which is current | Single source of truth / audit trail |
| **Vendor/partner security questionnaires** | Manual completion of customer security questionnaires | Automated trust center / questionnaire responses |
| **Policy management** | Policies stored in docs/drives with no review cadence tracking | Policy lifecycle automation |
| **Personnel tracking** | Manual tracking of background checks, security training, access reviews | HR integration + automated reminders |

### For the Aviation Lab specifically:
- FAA test logs and calibration records likely tracked in spreadsheets
- Traceability of test specimens/results is audit-critical
- Customer (Boeing, Airbus) audit readiness is a recurring burden

## 4. Competitor Intelligence Brief: Vanta (Week of 2026-02-09)

### Current Positioning
Vanta remains the **market leader** in compliance automation, focused on SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and expanding framework coverage.

### Pricing (2026)
- **Entry-level:** ~$10,000/year (annual subscription, 1 framework)
- **Scales with:** Number of integrations, additional frameworks, company size
- **Criticism:** Startups/mid-size companies report paying **enterprise-level costs for features they don't use**. Bundled compliance modules force overspending even for single-framework needs (e.g., SOC 2 only).

### Recent Features & Focus
- Automated evidence collection from 300+ integrations
- Continuous control monitoring (real-time)
- Prebuilt policy templates
- Auditor collaboration portals
- Vendor security review automation
- **Focus remains on audit readiness** rather than broader operational compliance automation — noted gap by competitors

### Competitive Vulnerabilities
1. **Price sensitivity:** $10K+ entry point prices out many SMBs
2. **Bundling criticism:** Forces purchase of unused modules
3. **Audit-readiness focus:** Competitors (Drata, Secureframe, CyberSierra) positioning on broader automation
4. **Integration depth:** Some users report integrations lack depth for modern stacks

### Key Competitors to Watch
- **Drata** — Strong on continuous monitoring, competitive pricing
- **Secureframe** — Guided support + audit prep, gaining mid-market share
- **CyberSierra** — Newer entrant, positioning on IT audit automation

## 5. Recommendations for Onboarding State Machine & Shield Bot

### Onboarding State Machine Updates
- **Prospect Tier:** Flag testcorp.com as **LOW priority** (small domain-holding company) unless confirmed as the aviation lab entity (testcorp.net), which would be **MEDIUM priority** (regulated industry, real compliance needs).
- **Industry Playbook:** If aviation → use regulated-industry onboarding flow with emphasis on industry-specific compliance + IT security layering.
- **Entry Hook:** Lead with "replace spreadsheet chaos" messaging; emphasize time savings (industry benchmark: 2-3 days/month → 30 minutes with automation).

### Shield Bot Updates
- Add Vanta pricing intelligence ($10K+ entry) to competitive battlecard
- Update objection handling: "Unlike Vanta, we don't force you to buy bundled modules you don't need"
- Add pain-point trigger: When prospect mentions "spreadsheets" or "manual evidence gathering," surface ROI calculator
