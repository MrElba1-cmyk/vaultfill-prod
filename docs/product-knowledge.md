# VaultFill Product Knowledge (Tier B)

This document is **VaultFill system/product information** intended to support sales and onboarding answers.

**Important:** Keep claims conservative and truthful. If a detail is unknown or not yet implemented, say so.

## What VaultFill does

VaultFill helps teams respond to security questionnaires faster by:
- Indexing security and compliance documents into a searchable Knowledge Vault
- Drafting questionnaire responses grounded in available documentation
- Supporting a conversion-first onboarding flow (capture email/company, then follow up)

## Shield Bot behavior (high level)

- **Admin intents** (greetings, signup/pricing, email capture) use deterministic scripts.
- **Security/technical questions** use retrieval over the Knowledge Vault with citation discipline.
- If coverage is missing, Shield Bot uses a **soft fallback**: it explains the gap and offers next steps (upload policy, clarify scope, or general best-practice guidance labeled as such).

## Privacy posture (truthful baseline)

- VaultFill is built with privacy in mind.
- We minimize data retention where possible.
- Do not claim absolute anonymity.
- Do not claim “not stored” unless a specific retention policy is provided.

## Early access / pilot

For early access or pilot interest:
- Ask for **email** and **company name**.
- Confirm signup and route the lead to the VaultFill team.
