MISSION: Analyze world-class SaaS marketing sites and redesign VaultFill's workflow section with animations/interactions worthy of a billion-dollar company.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Product: VaultFill - Security questionnaire automation tool
- Current State: Static 3-card workflow explanation (Ingest → Generate → Export)
- Goal: Create an immersive, interactive workflow demo that sells the product visually
- Tech Stack: Next.js 16, React, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS
- File Location: src/components/WorkflowDemo.tsx (new component to create)
- Integration Point: src/app/page.tsx (replace existing static workflow cards)

RESEARCH PHASE - Analyze these world-class examples:
1. Linear.app - Fluid animations, subtle micro-interactions, sophisticated transitions
2. Vercel.com - Clean timeline animations, smooth scroll-triggered reveals
3. Stripe.com/payments - Product demo animations showing data flow
4. Retool.com - Interactive product walkthroughs with real UI previews
5. Loom.com - Step-by-step process visualization with motion
6. Notion.so - Elegant state transitions and hover effects
7. Framer.com - Advanced Framer Motion techniques, spring physics
8. Railway.app - Modern glassmorphism, depth, and layering

FOCUS AREAS TO STUDY:
- How do they visualize data/document flow?
- What micro-interactions make it feel premium? (hover states, cursor effects, parallax)
- How do they use depth/layering? (shadows, blur, z-axis movement)
- What animation timing/easing creates that "expensive" feel?
- How do they balance auto-play vs user control?
- What loading states, progress indicators, success states do they use?

CREATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Must feel premium - like a $10M+ marketing site, not a template
✓ Tells the story: "messy documents → AI magic → clean answers"
✓ Should make non-technical buyers understand the value instantly
✓ Needs "wow" moment - something unexpected/delightful
✓ Mobile responsive (don't sacrifice mobile for desktop wow-factor)
✓ Performance conscious (smooth 60fps, no jank)

WORKFLOW STORY TO VISUALIZE:
Step 1 - "Ingest Evidence"
- Show actual document types: PDFs, policies, audit reports
- Visualize parsing/indexing (maybe text extraction, chunking animation?)
- Knowledge Vault filling up with searchable content
- Success state: "Evidence indexed and ready"

Step 2 - "Generate Drafts" 
- Show a real security question appearing
- AI "reading" through documents (maybe highlight matching sections?)
- Answer being drafted word-by-word or section-by-section
- Citations appearing and linking back to source docs
- Confidence score or quality indicator
- Success state: "Draft ready for review"

Step 3 - "Approve & Export"
- Reviewer interface with approve/edit controls
- Track changes or comment system
- Audit log showing who approved what
- Export options (Excel, Word, PDF)
- Success state: "Questionnaire complete - 8 minutes instead of 2 weeks"

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Must use Framer Motion (already installed: framer-motion@12.33.0)
- Component must be client-side: 'use client' directive
- No external dependencies beyond what's installed
- Should work with existing design system (CSS variables: --fg, --muted, --vault-blue, --border)
- Must handle reduced motion preferences (useReducedMotion)
- Consider code splitting if component is large

DELIVERABLES:
1. New file: src/components/WorkflowDemo.tsx
2. Updated: src/app/page.tsx (import and use WorkflowDemo, remove static cards)
3. Implementation notes: Explain key animation choices and techniques used
4. Performance notes: Any optimization strategies employed

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
□ Does it look like it cost $50k+ to produce?
□ Would a non-technical CFO understand the value after watching it?
□ Does it use advanced animation techniques beyond basic fade/slide?
□ Are there delightful micro-interactions that reward exploration?
□ Does it feel native to the existing site design (not bolted-on)?
□ Is it smooth on both desktop and mobile?
□ Does it tell a clear story without requiring explanation?

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Don't just make it "move more" - make it purposeful and elegant
- Study the easing curves and spring physics of reference sites
- Less is often more - a few perfect animations > many mediocre ones
- The goal is to make people go "wow, this product is legit"
- Consider adding a "See it in action" CTA that triggers a full demo cycle

FILE STRUCTURE:
src/components/WorkflowDemo.tsx - Main component
src/app/page.tsx - Integration point (replace motion.div grid around line 422)

CURRENT WORKFLOW SECTION LOCATION:
Line ~422 in src/app/page.tsx:
  <motion.section id="how-it-works" ...>
    Replace the grid of static cards with: <WorkflowDemo />

Begin analysis and implementation. Show me world-class.
