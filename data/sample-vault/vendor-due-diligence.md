# Vendor Due Diligence (Sample)

## Typical questionnaire sections

- Company & security program overview
- Data handling (PII/PHI), sub-processors
- Access controls (MFA, SSO, least privilege)
- Secure SDLC and change management
- Logging, monitoring, and alerting
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Business continuity / disaster recovery
- Incident response and breach notification timelines

## Good wording for questionnaire answers

- State what you do today.
- State scope (production systems, corporate endpoints, third-party services).
- Reference policies and procedures without over-sharing.
- Provide evidence options: screenshots, policy excerpts, audit reports (SOC 2), pen test executive summaries.
