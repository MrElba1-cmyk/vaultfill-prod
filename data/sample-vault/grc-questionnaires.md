# VaultFill Knowledge Vault (Sample)

## How to answer security questionnaires

- Keep responses short, factual, and scoped.
- Avoid absolute statements ("always", "never") unless true.
- When a control is partially implemented, state what exists, what's planned, and target dates.

## Common evidence examples

### Access control / IAM
- IdP screenshots (Okta/Azure AD) showing MFA policies
- Role/Group membership export
- Access review ticket samples (redacted)

### Encryption at rest
- Cloud provider settings (e.g., AWS EBS encryption, RDS encryption)
- KMS key policy overview
- Architecture diagram noting encrypted datastores

### Vulnerability management
- Scan cadence policy
- Sample scan reports (redacted)
- Patch SLAs and exceptions workflow

### Incident response
- IR policy + runbook
- Post-incident review template
- On-call / escalation matrix

## SOC 2 mappings (high level)

- CC6: Logical and physical access controls
- CC7: System operations, change management, and risk mitigation
- CC8: Change management

## Helpful patterns

- When asked for "Yes/No": respond with "Yes" and a brief qualifier, or "Partially" with specifics.
- Offer evidence types even if you cannot attach evidence directly.
